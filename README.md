## FAQs

#### Will following the settings mentioned here ensure complete privacy?
While following these settings can significantly minimize data collection and tracking by the mentioned services/software, it is important to note that absolute privacy and security on the internet are difficult to achieve. Even with these settings, there may still be some level of data collection or tracking. It is advisable to explore and utilize privacy-respecting alternatives whenever possible for enhanced privacy.

#### Why are privacy invading services like Facebook, Zoom, Google etc. mentioned here? Isn't this repo focused on privacy?
While the aim of this repo is to promote privacy, there may be instances where the use of privacy-invading services/software is necessary. For example, using Zoom for work meetings or a social media platform for business purposes. The goal here is to minimize data collection and enhance digital privacy as much as possible, even when using privacy-invading services/software. However, it is highly encouraged to explore and adopt better privacy-respecting alternatives whenever available and suitable for your needs.

#### The settings for a particular software/service was updated months ago, when will it be updated according to latest version?
Settings for softwares/services may not require frequent updates with each new version. If there have been no significant changes that affect the settings, it will not be updated. If the latest version is mentioned, the settings provided already apply to that version, even if they were last updated months ago.



## Privacy Best Practices

- Follow the privacy settings recommended here.
- Opt for privacy respecting alternatives for search engines, emails, browsers etc.
- Enable multifactor authentication for added security.
- Keep your apps and operating system updated.
- Use open-source softwares and apps whenever possible (NOTE: open-source doesn't always necessarily mean secure).
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions for software and apps.
- Share information sparingly & only provide what is necessary.
- Consider using false information when appropriate (Never knowingly provide false information to legal entities, law enforcement, medical professionals, banks, etc.).
