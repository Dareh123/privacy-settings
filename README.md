## Privacy Best Practices
The TL;DR version of best practices for digital privacy:
- Follow the privacy settings mentioned here.
- Use strong passwords (preferably atleast 10 characters containing alphabets, numbers and special characters).
- Don't reuse passwords.
- Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
- Use better privacy respecting alternatives for search engines, emails, browsers etc.
- Use multifactor authentication.
- Keep apps and operating system updated.
- Use open-source softwares and apps whenever possible (NOTE: open-source doesn't always necessarily mean secure).
- Review permissions for softwares and apps and revoke unnecessary permissions.
- Only provide information as much as necessary.
- Provide false information when possible (Never knowingly give false information on a legal document, to a law enforcement officer, federal agency, medical personnel, banks etc).
- Use E2EE (End to End Encrypted) messaging services.
- Keep devices encrypted.
- Make regular backups.
- Spread the good information and make people aware around you.
